# Binary Curse
An esoteric programming language designed to scare you in binary. ðŸ˜ˆ

## Why build this?

I was curios when I first time saw some esolangs like BrainFuck, Malbolge, Befunge, Intercal, etc. I explored them and understood their working. Before touching Malbolge, I hit an idea to create my own esolang. I had built "Symbols" - an esolang inspired by BrainFuck without loops. Now, I'm designing this nightmare just for you.

## Core Working

The core of the working of this esolang is 0 and 1 meaning. Here '0' and '1' don't mean regular binary number. Here:
- **'0'** - Increment cell value (0 - 255)
- **'1'** - Call a subroutine based on cell's value

That's it! Welcome to the first stage of this curse.

## Subroutines Map

To code in this esolang you first need to understand "Subroutines Map" below:

| **Cell Value** | **Subroutine** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Start | Start execution of a program |
